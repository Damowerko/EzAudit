In particular, clarification is provided on the following issues:
  - under which conditions contract work for an FSC certified product can be provided for non-FSC certified CoC contracting organizations;
  - what the benefits and implications are for FSC certified CoC contracting organizations that use FSC certified CoC contractors.
The FSC Standard for Chain of Custody Certification (FSC-STD-40-004) requires organizations that take legal ownership of materials and want to maintain or change the FSC claim associated with the output product to have FSC Chain of Custody certification. The standard further specifies the requirements to follow for FSC certified CoC contracting organizations in order to use non-FSC certified CoC contractors for this purpose. 
The questions, however, what the implications are for an FSC certified CoC contracting organization to use FSC certified CoC contractors, and whether contract work for an FSC certified product could be provided also for non-FSC certified CoC contracting organizations were not consistently dealt with in practice. In particular the latter question required some fundamental judgement, as some certification bodies considered contract work for non-FSC certified CoC contracting organizations to be generally not in line with standard requirements, while others found outsourcing arrangements where the non-FSC certified CoC contracting organization would not obtain physical possession of the input material to be acceptable under certain additional stipulations.
This Advice Note follows the latter approach based on the judgement that there would not be an increased risk associated with such outsourcing arrangements for non-FSC certified products to be labelled and sold as FSC certified, provided that additional safeguards were in place. The Advice Note stipulates these safeguards and aims at providing the relevant answers to the questions raised above.

Outsourcing agreement: A written agreement between a contracting organization and a contractor about the service of producing or processing an FSC certified product or material, where the contracting organization retains control of and responsibility for the purchasing of input material from the (billing) supplier and for the sale of the output product to the customer.

Therefore, this Advice Note aims to clarify the actions that shall be taken by: 
a) Certification bodies when false claims are identified (see Graphic 2); 
b) blocked organizations and how they can reinstate and reestablish processes or activities in the scope of their certificate;  
c) Certificate holders with a valid COC certificate outsourcing services or adding a new group member or site to prevent a business relationship with blocked organizations; 
d) FSC and ASI when false claims are identified (see Graphic 2).

(1) the suspension of the Granted Rights, alternatively the termination of the License Agreement for the FSC Certification Scheme, and 
(2) the restriction from carrying out processes or activities that are included within the scope of their FSC certification.
Clear and convincing evidence: Evidence available to the certification body, ASI and/or FSC that supports a conclusion that a fact is substantially more probable to be true than not. In other words, there must be a firm conviction or belief that the organization deliberately made false claims. Clear and convincing evidence shall be supported by documents, facts, other information or records, either quantitative or qualitative, that can be verified through analysis, observation, measurement, and other means of research (See Graphic 1).
Contractor: Individual, company, or other legal entity contracted by an organization for any activities under the scope of an FSC COC certificate.
Deliberate: with knowledge and awareness of the consequences.
False claim: FSC claim made on sales documents (physical or electronic) or the use of the FSC trademarks, on products and for projects that are not eligible to be claimed, labelled and/or promoted as being FSC-certified or FSC Controlled Wood. A false claim is different from an inaccurate claim, in which a product, that is eligible to be sold as FSC certified, is sold with the wrong claim.
NOTE: An incident with a false claim is linked to a root cause and multiple incidents of false claims may originate from the same root cause. In all such cases, these instances of false claims (which would normally trigger a single non-conformity in an assessment) count as one false claim event for the purpose of this Advice Note.
FSC database: A computer-based system containing data about the FSC Certification Scheme (e.g. certificate holders, FSC licensees, etc.), accessible at www.info.fsc.org. 
Granted Rights: The right to use the FSC trademarks for FSC claims, as defined in FSC-STD-40-004, for on-product labeling on FSC-certified products and for promotional use worldwide as licensed and further regulated by via the FSC Trademark License Agreement.
Negligence: Failure to exercise reasonable care.
FSC Trademark License Agreement: The License Agreement for the FSC Certification Scheme signed by the certificate holder permitting use of the FSC trademarks (‘licensed materials’).",1

The current wording of this requirement is being interpreted in different ways by certification bodies and certificate holders. 

Species information is relevant for the establishment of product groups for the control of FSC claims and may only be substituted by another species provided that they are equivalen
T and do not change the output product characteristics, according to Box 04 of FSC-STD-40-004 V3-0. 

Due to laws on timber legality and advancements in wood identification technologies, the importance of transparency of species and origin of FSC certified products has increased.  
This advice note has the objective of clarifying the requirement, by addressing the request of being more specific on whether and how species information needs to be specified in FSC product groups.
